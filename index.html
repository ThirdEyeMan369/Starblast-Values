<h2>What is Starblast Values?</h2>
    <p>8values is a quiz that attempts to assign percentages for twelve different Starblast values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the twelve values?</h2>

<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
