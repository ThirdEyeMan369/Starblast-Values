<h2>What is Starblast Values?</h2>
    <p>Starblast Values is a quiz that attempts to assign percentages for twelve different Starblast values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>I'd go further</b> to <b>This sentence angers me</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
